# Test Configuration Fix

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: Test runner was showing "3 failed | 7 passed" because Vitest was trying to run Playwright E2E tests, which caused compatibility errors.

**Root Cause**: The vitest configuration was including E2E test files that should only be run with Playwright.

## Solution Applied

### Updated `vitest.config.ts`

Added E2E test exclusions to prevent Vitest from running Playwright tests:

```typescript
exclude: [
  "node_modules",
  ".next",
  "dist",
  "coverage",
  "**/*.stories.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  "tests/e2e/**",        // ← Added
  "**/e2e/**"            // ← Added
],
```

## Current Test Status ✅

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

```
✅ Test Files  7 passed (7)
✅ Tests       185 passed (185)
✅ Duration    1.79s
```

**Passing Test Suites:**

- ✅ `src/design-system/primitives/Card/Card.test.tsx` (13 tests)
- ✅ `src/design-system/primitives/Typography/Typography.test.tsx` (50 tests)
- ✅ `src/design-system/primitives/Button/Button.test.tsx` (10 tests)
- ✅ `src/design-system/primitives/Input/Input.test.tsx` (50 tests)
- ✅ `src/design-system/primitives/Badge/Badge.test.tsx` (10 tests)
- ✅ `src/shared/services/__tests__/project-service.core.test.ts` (20 tests)
- ✅ `src/shared/services/__tests__/project-service.test.ts` (32 tests)

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

E2E tests should be run separately with:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Commands Available

| Command                 | Purpose                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `npm test`              | Run unit tests only (Vitest)    |
| `npm run test:watch`    | Run unit tests in watch mode    |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run unit tests with coverage    |
| `npm run test:e2e`      | Run E2E tests only (Playwright) |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui`   | Run E2E tests with UI           |
| `npm run test:all`      | Run both unit and E2E tests     |

## Quality Metrics Achieved

### Unit Test Coverage

- **185 tests passing** across 7 test suites
- **Design System Components**: Comprehensive testing
- **Service Layer**: Business logic validation
- **TypeScript**: Zero compilation errors

### Test Architecture

- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Unit tests (Vitest) vs E2E tests (Playwright)
- ✅ **Proper Tool Usage**: Each test type uses appropriate runner
- ✅ **Clean Execution**: No cross-contamination between test types
- ✅ **Parallel Execution**: Both test types can run independently

---

**Result**: All unit tests now pass cleanly with proper separation between unit testing (Vitest) and E2E testing (Playwright) frameworks.
