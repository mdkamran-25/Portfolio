      <Text>
        Modern web development has evolved significantly over the past decade. Today's applications
        require careful consideration of performance, accessibility, and user experience. This
        article explores best practices for building applications that stand the test of time.
      </Text>

      <Heading level={3}>Key Principles</Heading>

      <Text>When building modern applications, we should focus on several core principles:</Text>

        <li>
          <Text as="span">Performance optimization from the ground up</Text>

      <Text>
        Building modern web applications requires balancing multiple concerns: performance,
        maintainability, accessibility, and user experience. By following established patterns and
        leveraging modern tools, we can create applications that serve users effectively while
        remaining manageable for development teams.
